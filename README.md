# vf-react-onblur-save

This is a simple page and React app that lets a user bounce around a form, and when moving inputs, will try to save their work to the server. In this example, when the user blurs from an input, a call is made to the a remote action method with the Account record. If there is an error, the inputs are disabled and the error is displayed for the user; otherwise, nothing happens and the user may continue.
